Antenna.

Usage:
    antennna listen <profile> <queue> <command>
    antenna configure <profile> <queue> <command>

The most stupidly simple way to scale an application is through a message queue,
at least where latency is not an issue. If you're using the AWS ecosystem, the
most stupidly simple way to run tasks based on messages from a message queue is
through Antenna.

Grab a message from a queue, run a command and if it worked, remove the message:

    antenna listen <profile> <queue> "<command>" \
        1> antenna.log \
        2> antenna.err.log

Antenna will look for credentials in either `~/.aws/config` (this is where your
AWS CLI credentials live) or `~/.boto`.

    [profile my-profile-name]
    aws_access_key_id=<id>
    aws_secret_access_key=<secret>
    region=<region>

Install Antenna with `pip`, the Python package installer.

    pip install sqs-antenna

While Antenna will run indefinitely, executing your command for each message it
receives, it's probably still safe to run Antenna as a daemon.

If you're on Ubuntu, you can run Antenna as a daemon by adding it to Upstart:

    antenna configure <profile> <queue> "<command>" > /etc/init/<task>.conf
    initctl reload-configuration
    start <task>
